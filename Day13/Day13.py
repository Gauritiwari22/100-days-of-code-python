my_function()

# here is the above program, on checking closely we see that nothing gets printed on calling the function
# because when we use the for loop to iterate over the range of numbers, it never reaches 20, because
# range(1,20) means numbers from 1 to 10 i.e 20 is excluded hence i never equals 20. Hence, nothing gets printed

"Coorected version"

# If we input the year as 1994, on executing nothing will get printed as 1994 is not included in any
# of the if-elif conditions hence the computer does not print anything.

# If we input any numeric value like 45, 23, 10 etc, there will be an error shown in the console.
# by default, the input function takes string values and hence you cannot compare string values to
# integers. Therefore, for comparison similar data types shall be considered.

"Corrected version"

# Using Exception handling
