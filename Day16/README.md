# Day 16 – Coffee Machine (OOP)

This project is part of Day 16 of the **100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

The project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, and methods.

## Credits

The starter class files (`coffee_maker.py`, `menu.py`, `money_machine.py`) were provided as part of the course by Angela Yu.

The main program logic and integration of these classes were implemented by me.
