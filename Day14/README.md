# Higher Lower Game 

##  About the Project
The **Higher Lower Game** is a Python-based console game where the player compares two famous personalities, brands, or social media platforms and guesses **who has more followers**.

The goal is simple:
- Guess correctly to increase your score
- One wrong guess ends the game

This project is designed to strengthen **core Python fundamentals** through a fun, logic-based game.

##  How the Game Works
1. Two random entities are selected from a dataset.
2. Each entity has:
   - Name  
   - Description  
   - Country  
   - Follower count 
3. The player inputs:
   - **A** if they think option A has more followers
   - **B** if they think option B has more followers
4. If the guess is correct:
   - Score increases
   - Game continues
5. If the guess is wrong:
   - Game ends
   - Final score is displayed
