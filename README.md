# 100 Days of Code – Python

This repository documents my Python learning journey as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge.

I am learning Python from scratch and using this repository to practice daily, understand core concepts, and build simple programs and beginner-level projects. 
The focus is on consistency, clarity, and improving problem-solving skills step by step.

Each day’s work is organized into folders and may includes short notes and projects related to what I learned that day.

This repository will be updated regularly as I continue learning and progressing.
